Finding the right MS-products to get started on a project is not always
as easy as it should be. If one wishes to make their own IPs
(Integration Packs) they need the Orchestrator Integration Toolkit. This
does however require the WiX Toolset, and most of you will hit a page
providing version 3.7, while you actually need 3.5 (atleast I couldn\'t
get it to work with 3.7). Downloads below:

-   [WiX Toolset 3.5](http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/60102)
-   [Orchestrator Integration
    Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28725) (the
    third of three available downloads)
