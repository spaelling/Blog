I find it tedious to create parameter files for my ARM templates. With
the script I just wrote you don\'t have to.

Simply point at the ARM template that you need a parameter file for, and
the function will spit out the json that matches. Pipe it to Out-File or
\"clip\" to put it in your clipboard and paste it into Visual Studio or
other ARM template editor of choice.
