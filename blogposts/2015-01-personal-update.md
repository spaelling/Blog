This blog just broke the 10.000 pageviews, I just broke 1.000 points on
[Technet](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/anders%20sp%C3%A6lling/),
and I am starting a new job at [Lumagate](http://www.lumagate.com/) as
Senior System Center Consultant!

So thing are going pretty well in my professional career. I will be
taking a bunch of certifications over the next few months (being
autodidact doesn\'t count for much in this regard), and therefore I
doubt there will be much time for blogging and helping the poor
unfortunate souls on Technet.
Also summer is coming\.... And I am quite the garden enthusiast, and
looking forward to spending lots of time out in the sun, tending my
precious plants :D Yes, I have way too many hobbies, and just can\'t
find time for it all.
Anyways, thanks for reading.
