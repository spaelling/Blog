I currently have a million tabs open with all kinds of goodie
blog-posts. To make it easier for me (and hopefully also others).

-   This is pretty much a must read: [How to Add the Service Manager
    Authoring Tool's Form Controls to Visual
    Studio](http://blog.concurrency.com/infrastructure/how-to-add-the-service-manager-authoring-tools-form-controls-to-visual-studio/)
-   [C\# code snippets for Service Manager
    \#1](http://scsmnz.net/c-code-snippets-for-service-manager-1/)
    - code snippets by Rob Ford. Lots of code snippets - just read them
    all!
-   [C\# code snippets for Service Manager
    \#2](http://scsmnz.net/c-code-snippets-for-service-manager-2/) -
    more code snippets by Rob Ford. He shows code on: Custom console
    tasks, how to use IDataItem (interface SCSM objects), working with
    workflows, how to approve a RA, and lastly how to get a user from an
    SMTP address
-   [Service Manager 2012 -- How to disable form controls for a Resolved
    or Closed Incident -- Part
    1](http://scsmnz.net/service-manager-2012-how-to-disable-form-controls-for-a-resolved-or-closed-incident-part-1/) -
    exactly as the title tells us. A good starting tutorial for
    customizing SCSM using C\# and Visual Studio. [Part 2 is
    here](http://scsmnz.net/service-manager-2012-how-to-disable-form-controls-for-a-resolved-or-closed-incident-part-2/).

    required on IR and SR forms: SCSM 2012

    form](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/customization/thread/3b44dc26-ead0-4bad-b1fd-72bfa49e84f9),
    and [How to: Create a Custom Validation
    Rule](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182556(v=vs.80).aspx).

    mentioned ones.
