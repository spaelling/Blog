What have you been doing this weekend? I have been slacking (don\'t tell
my boss). Most people in IT have heard of [Slack](https://slack.com/) by
now. If not, you should check it out.\'

Slack is normally used for team collaboration, but I wanted to see if I
could \"*be less busy*\" in my privatelife too. Just too many apps I
cycle between to check if something is new; Feedly, YouTube, Facebook,
LinkedIn, Huffingtong Post, Twitter to name a few.
For a private user you will most likely stay in the free tier. This
means that you are limited to 10 apps/integrations. But as you will
learn, you can get a long way with just a few apps.
So what I have done so far is create some channels.
-   general (default, can\'t leave it)
-   message
-   news
-   reminders
-   social
-   todo
-   youtube
```
The idea is to put stuff like email and other direct messages into the
message channel. News is for, well news. Reminders is linked to my gmail
calendar where I keep my private appointments and appointments for work
that goes outside normal work hours. Social is for stuff like Facebook
and Twitter. Todo is meant for keeping a todo-list, and finally the
youtube channel is for my YouTube channel subscriptions.
```
```
```
```
Each channel will highligh if there is something new in them, and since
I am the sole member on the team, I know it is an app or bot that has
updated the channel.
```
```
```
```
So far I have been able to link my Gmail to the *message *channel using
[ifttt.com](http://ifttt.com/). This is one way, meaning I get notified
of new email and can see the body of the email. I also would like my
iMessages in there, but I have yet to find an integration that can do
this. There are other integrations that I have not tried yet (I just
dont use alot of messaging apps):
```
```
-   [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/features/slack/)
-   Facebook Messenger (LinkedIn messaging, etc.)
```
Facebook Messenger is not something I use alot, but sometimes. There is
an integration through
[Smooch](https://smooch.io/integrations/messenger/), but that seems to
be limited to Facebook Pages (makes sense in a business perspective).
[Zapier](http://zapier.com/) (has loads of advanced Slack
integrations) and looks also to target Pages.
```
```
```
It basically allows you to get messages send to a Facebook Page into
Slack. And reply from Slack also.
```
```
```
```
For the *news* channel I have lots of RSS feeds. That is simply using an
RSS app (there are 3 or so of those) and then adding configurations for
each feed.
```

  Some science news from Huffington Post
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Now a little trick that I learned; There was no RSS feed for *I fucking
love science*, so I resorted to <https://twitrss.me/> as all (?) new
articles are tweeted from the *iflscience* user. RSS feeds can sometimes
be the answer when wanting to integrate something with Slack.
```
```
I have also connected [slalert](http://www.slalert.com/) to the news
channel. That is a more generic way to get news. I have yet to get
something from Slalert, but then I have not put alot of keywords in it
yet. It simply connects to a Slack webhook and whenever it finds
something on the keywords you have given Slalert it will post it to the
channel the webook is connected to.
```
```
```
```
The *reminders* channel is currently linked to my Gmail calendar (there
is an app called Google Calendar - doesn\'t get much easier than that).
You can choose which of your calendars to sync to Slack and then how far
in advance to remind you of an event.
```
```
You can also just tell the slackbot to remind you or someone else (or
even a channel) of something.
```
```

  Resisting temptation to remind me again in 15 minutes :D

The social channel was supposed to cover me in Facebook, Twitter, and
other social networks. It would be nice to be able to get the Facebook
*news feed* in Slack, but Facebook closed down that part of the API in
2015. I guess it allowed people to get the essence of Facebook on a
different platform than Facebook, removing their main source of income
(advertisements).
```
```
I guess the story will be much the same, now or in the future, for other
social networks, so I will not even try.
```
```
```
```
The *todo* channel was to function as a todo-list. I can use something
like Slack *posts* (a file of sorts) and star them. Or pin them to the
todo channel. It is possible to pin all kinds of items.
```
```
```
```
The *youtube* channel is for my YouTube subscriptions. I can get the
feed of each subscribed YouTube channel and add them to my RSS app. I
could not find a way to programatically add all of the subscribed
channels, so abit of manual work was needed. And when I subscribe to a
new channel I will have to add it here. I guess it is a matter of time
before someone writes a YouTube app for Slack.
```
```
```
```
So have I really *slackified* my life? Not quite. But it is a step in
the right direction. Slack is still pretty new, and as apps are
developed specifically for some of the things I have had to hack abit to
get working, things will get better and more feature-rich.
```
```
The focus is obviously on features that can be used by actual teams (and
not the solo-slacker). And still, limited by what APIs are offered by
the provider in the other end. They will not be willing to just fully
let go and have users leave their platform entirely.
```
```
